## A Survey on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis on Social Conversational Text

This survey intends to provide an extensive review of the most notable advancements of **aspect based sentiment analysis on conversational text** in the time frame 2016 to 2019. Sentiment analysis at the aspect granularity, called *aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA)*, has emerged as a promising research direction. 

From the overview, it is apparent that deep learning architectures augmented with *attention* and *memory network* have demonstrated to be established techniques in the field. Furthermore, the acceptance of 4 publications on Twitter dataset based ABSA, in top tier conferences like AAAI, ACL and NAACL in the year 2019, depicts the *growing interest in non-structured social media data*. The discussed research publications are clustered for organization and highlighting existing and future research directions.



**Social Media** : Social media platforms such as forum discussions and micro-blogs generate conversational text corpora principally from human interaction and collective behavior, hence garnering attention from disciplines like sociology, business, psychology, politics, economics, etc. The application of ABSA on social conversational text is therefore an encouraging attempt to understand social patterns, user attitude, and future behavioral trends.
