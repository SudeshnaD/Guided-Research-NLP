## A Survey on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis on Social Conversational Text

Sentiment analysis at the aspect granularity, called *aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA)*, has emerged as a promising research direction. This report is a **comprehensive review** of the recent research efforts attempted for analyzing **conversational social media corpora using aspect based sentiment analysis**. 

**Social Media** : Social media platforms such as forum discussions and micro-blogs generate conversational text corpora principally from human interaction and collective behavior, hence garnering attention from disciplines like sociology, business, psychology, politics, economics, etc. The application of ABSA on social conversational text is therefore an encouraging attempt to understand social patterns, user attitude, and future behavioral trends.

This report is organized as follows:

- Section 3 talks about related work. 
- Section 4 discusses the focus of this report,
- Section 5 presents the open challenges in this domain, the relevant datasets, and reviews the relevant publications along with results. 

The discussed publications are **categorized based on model architectures** to obtain an overview of the prevailing trends in the field of our research topic and highlight the best performing architecture. 

Each publication has been analyzed under the framework:
- challenges
